Welcome to the SMS Spam Detection project!

Spam messages pose a significant threat to communication channels, inundating users with unwanted and potentially harmful content. This project addresses the challenge of identifying and filtering out spam messages using machine learning techniques.

Utilizing a dataset comprising labeled examples of spam and non-spam (ham) SMS messages, this project employs natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to classify incoming messages as either spam or legitimate.

By leveraging the power of text classification models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), this project aims to provide users with an effective solution for detecting and mitigating spam in their messaging platforms.
