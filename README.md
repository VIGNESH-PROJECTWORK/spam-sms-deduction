# SMS Spam Detection

## Overview

SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying spam messages from legitimate ones (ham). The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically classify incoming SMS messages as spam or ham.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the SMS spam detection model consists of labeled examples of SMS messages, indicating whether each message is spam or ham. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Algorithms Used

- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Usage

To run the SMS spam detection model:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/VIGNESH-PROJECTWORK/spam-sms-deduction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd spam-sms-deduction

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main script:

python sms_spam_detection.py

Follow the instructions provided to input a sample SMS message and see the model's classification result.

## Results

The performance of the SMS spam detection model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are presented in the project report along with visualizations to assess the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham messages.

## Contributing

Contributions to the SMS spam detection project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the model, adding new features, or fixing bugs, please feel free to submit a pull request.
